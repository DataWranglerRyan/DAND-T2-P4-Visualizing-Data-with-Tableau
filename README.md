# DAND-T2-P4-Tableau-Airline-Delays
Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree's Term 2 fourth project: Visualizing Data.

The goal of this project is to visualize data in a clean, efficient, and insightful
way using Tableau.

The final visualization can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan.gee#!/vizhome/TravelSmart-ArriveOnTimeVersion2/TravelSmartGuide)

This visualization serves as a guide to help travelers determine which airports, airlines, months, and days of the week to avoid if they want to arrive at their destination on time. It is an interactive experience that allows the user to pick their origin and destination, and in return they get insight on what to avoid. For example, if you were flying out of Denver in 2001 then July has the longest average arrival delay. The visualization is powered by RITA flight delay data from 2001.
